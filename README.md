I wanted to practice my vanilla javascript abilities as well as practice CSS positioning. The way I went about this was by creating a simple 2D fighting game.  This project does not use any npm packages or CSS libraries. I also did not use HTML canvas for this project.

The user can control the character and can jump, move left and right, and at an attack. 

1. I wanted to character to be able to move left and right.

2. I wanted to character to be able to jump.

## Usage 

The usage of this project is to have a fun little fighting game. The user can control the character on the left. The controls are: A key to move left, D key to move right, W key to jump, and the spacebar key to attack. The character will attack in the direction that they were last moving. Have fun!!

The resource that I looked at to get me started was a youtube video that made a simplified version of Google's dinosaur game. [youtube link](https://youtu.be/bG2BmmYr9NQ)
